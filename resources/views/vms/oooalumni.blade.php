<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pic-for-Msg.jpg" alt="Mr Sunil Kant Munjal - Chairman BOGS" width="250" vspace="0" hspace="10"></p>
<p>It is indeed a great honour and responsibility to chair the Board of Governors for the next five years. I am grateful to members of the IPSS for choosing me to succeed Sunil K Munjal.</p>
<p>The driving force to help in earnest cannot be based on guilt or pressure; but a deep sense of inner gratitude and a sustained wish to help do whatever little unconditionally. This deep sense of gratitude emanates from the two-fold test i.e. ability to do and the intention to deliver&#8230;thus the wherewithal to have the ability to help/assist co-existing with an inner desire of positivity to work and deliver is where we find ourselves blessed.</p>
<p>Formal education taps latent abilities and opens up an altogether different world. Education has enormous transformative power for any given crisis. Everyone deserves the best start in life, and that won’t be possible without quality education. If we need our future to be just and sustainable, we have to think collectively. For this gathered effort, education is the strongest tool. Education cannot be restricted to a single period of one&#8217;s life. Everyone, beginning with the most marginalized and disadvantaged members of our societies, must be entitled to lifelong learning opportunities for both employment/career perspectives as well as personal knowledge and development. </p>
<p>The School’s mission is to attract and develop exceptional students and teachers from all backgrounds to serve a meritocratic India. The Doon School is an inclusive school that celebrates and embraces diversity. Diversity for us is in terms of geography, socio-economic background, and skill sets.</p>
<p>Differentiated learning and teaching strategies along with an inclusive approach are at the core of the curriculum.</p>
<p>We recognize the Doon School is uniquely different from other legacy schools due to its mission. The school aspires for truly secular and democratic values to serve a meritocratic India.</p>
<p>Academics at The Doon School is a distinguishing characteristic. It challenges the intellect and nurtures the potential of each student to acquire knowledge, concepts, and skills necessary to become thinking, productive, and responsible citizens. Excellence in academics at Doon inculcates lifelong learning in the students.</p>
<p>Sports has been an integral part of The Doon School education. This belief stems from the philosophy that learning occurs both inside the classroom and outside of it. Participation in sports keeps young minds and bodies engaged positively and helps to develop sensorimotor faculties. </p>
<p>Additionally, the co-curricular program is perhaps the soul of The Doon School where the aim is to promote the spirit of exploration, curiosity, character development, team building, building strategies, leadership, individualism, and overall empathy for all. The list of skills that we have is not an exhaustive one. A few examples are resilience, empathy, leadership, integrity, communication, collaboration, etc. The activity program that we offer aims to instill these skills. </p>
<p>In the Doon School, the students are given equal attention in the field of academics, co-curricular and sports activities. This balance while understanding the needs of students is a unique learning experience. To grow in the direction of success, one needs support and assistance, the ability to learn and the indelible passion to deliver. Besides our students we inspire all our other stakeholders, be it the Teachers or the Parents to continuously upgrade and be sensitive to our students’ needs at School and at home. We believe that the Student’s most formidable years in life is spent at The Doon School. Growth not only physically and intellectually but also psychological and emotional is during the ages 12-18 years. Our aim and hope is that a Doon School student inculcates exemplary sense of values, the zeal to excel in academics and sports and above all, be a good human being.</p>
<p>Our priority, as has been so of my predecessors, is to ensure a progressive, inspiring, stimulating and above all, a happy environment in School. The Board, the Headmaster and the school management remain committed to this endeavor.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
<span><b>Anoop Singh Bishnoi</b></span>

<h3 class="inr-hd-bg">Message from the Chairman of the Board</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.doonschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mr-Sunil-K-Munjal-Chairman-BOGS.jpg" alt="Mr Sunil Kant Munjal - Chairman BOGS" width="250" vspace="0" hspace="10"></p>
<p>Dear Fellow Doscos,</p>
<p>It is a great honour and responsibility to chair the Board of   Governors for the next five years. I&rsquo;m grateful to members of the IPSS   for asking me to succeed Gautam Thapar.</p>
<p>The School has diligently implemented the Development Plan that was   designed after much deliberation about eight years ago. For the coming   years, we hope to continue this broad approach, and introduce some new   initiatives.</p>
<p>In recent discussions, many of us have articulated the need to   trigger a shift that will help India&rsquo;s best school be counted amongst   the best, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>One of the major initiatives of the IPSS Board and the school will be   to enhance the Doon School status as an &lsquo;Elite&rsquo;, needs-blind   Institution, that seek to attract the best talent from around the   country.  Simultaneously, the effort will be build a diverse pool of   parents and guardians who send their wards to the school.</p>
<p>Cultivating this &ldquo;more inclusive&rsquo;&rsquo; image necessitates a substantial   corpus. The earned income from the corpus should be enough to provide   scholarships to assist those students and parents who are unable to pay   the full school fee.  The fee, in the meantime, will continue to be   pegged to cover the full cost of operating the school along with   attendant costs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Doon School will continue to develop a vigorous   admission process.  Among the planned new initiatives, there will be an   effort to bring students from multiple regions and language   backgrounds, and to develop an even stronger student exchange program.</p>
<p>To ensure that our boys get into good universities in India and   overseas, academics will now be more intensely hardwired into the school   development plan. It is especially important that we finetune a robust   system that suits the requirements and aspirations of all students and   parents.</p>
<p>Yet, the Doon School is not an assembly line; the aim of this   institution never was, and should never be, to produce crammers.   Therefore, students must have many more opportunities to take decisions   in school activities; this will allow them to make and learn from   mistakes, feel empathy and gain confidence.</p>
<p>I also feel that students need much more exposure to real life issues   and challenges to ask the right questions; think independently; and   balance the complexities of life. Therefore, many more outside experts   and speakers must be brought in to widen their horizons.</p>
<p>As the education environment around the world evolves, what will   separate good institutions from great ones is the ability to attract   teaching talent through the right work environment, living conditions   and compensation structure. Hence, the School&rsquo;s focus will be on two   areas: to develop a continuously flowing pipeline of fresh talent—and to   ensure that the existing talents can upskill through a mix of training,   coaching exposure and counselling.</p>
<p>Though the School infrastructure is currently   adequate and amongst the best available, there is still a need to add   and restructure a few more facilities. Plans in this area are under   consideration.</p>
<p>The intent going forward will also be to ensure that the facilities   are optimally used, with more emphasis on operations, maintenance and   upkeep. For example, investments in technology need to be supported with   appropriate coaching and counselling of teachers and faculty — so that   the entire ecosystem is adaptive and responsive to change.</p>
<p>As many of the projects under the school&rsquo;s current development plan   are complete, it is time to create a suitable plan for the next 10   years. This will make the School truly future-ready and allow it to be   measured against, and recognised, amongst the leading institutions   globally. Besides creating physical infrastructure, any plan that we   execute must focus on the value system — EQ, IQ, and health (both   physical and mental) — so that a happy and productive environment   continues to build a pipeline of future leaders.</p>
<p>Some of these plans can be implemented quickly, others will need   time. So, the aim of the Board, the school management and its Headmaster, will be to work together, set priorities,   and put together an efficient and executable action agenda.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my priority would be to ensure that the momentum   generated by the previous leadership team is sustained. I look forward   to working with you as we progress towards a Doon School Century and   build one of the truly great Institutions in school education in the   world.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
